# Comprehensive Implementation Roadmap for the Tokio Preemption System

## Executive Summary

Tokio's cooperative scheduler enables efficient multiplexing of many asynchronous tasks onto a small number of threads, but it suffers from a critical fairness gap: tasks that do not yield can monopolise worker threads, starving other tasks and degrading latency. Recent research across Go, BEAM, JVM, OS schedulers, HPC runtimes and Rust ecosystem tooling has culminated in an optimised architecture for adding preemption to Tokio. This roadmap translates that architecture into a detailed, actionable plan. It is organised into four major phases—Foundation & Core Infrastructure, Tokio Integration & Multi‑Tier Management, Advanced Features & Ecosystem Integration, and Production Readiness & Comprehensive Validation—with an additional Implementation Guidelines section.

## Resource Requirements and Complexity Assessment

This roadmap assumes a team of 2–3 senior Rust developers and 1–2 QA/CI engineers. The estimated duration is 18–24 months, reflecting the complexity of modifying the runtime, implementing cross‑platform support and achieving production‑grade stability. Budget tasks rely on research showing <100 ns per poll overhead with relaxed atomics and 1.2–2.2 µs context switch times. The overall success criteria include: (1) demonstrable prevention of task starvation, (2) less than 1% throughput regression for well‑behaved workloads, (3) cross‑platform functionality on Linux, Windows and macOS, and (4) adherence to elite quality standards for code, documentation and testing.

# Implementation Guidelines

## Development Workflow and Quality Gates

### Local Validation
- Use pre‑commit hook to enforce formatting, Clippy pedantic lints, documentation generation, tests and security audit
- Fix issues before committing

### CI Checks
- CI runs on each commit and PR; includes build, test, doc, lint, audit, benchmark and coverage
- Any failing job blocks merge

### Code Reviews
- All changes must be reviewed by at least one senior developer
- Review checklists should include adherence to coding standards, documentation completeness, test coverage and performance impact

### Feature Branches
- Use feature branches for major features (e.g., scheduler hooks, TierManager, macros)
- Merge into develop branch via PR; main branch tracks releases

### Performance Monitoring
- Integrate criterion benchmarks into CI; track performance over time
- Investigate regressions immediately

### Cross‑Platform Testing
- Run all tests and benchmarks on Linux, Windows and macOS
- Fix platform-specific issues promptly

## Performance Monitoring & Regression Detection

### Benchmark Baselines
- Store baseline benchmark results in repository or external service
- Compare new runs against baseline; set thresholds for acceptable degradation

### Continuous Monitoring
- Use metrics exported to Prometheus to monitor production workloads
- Set alerts for high slow poll ratios or budget exhaustion counts
- Use tracing and console for diagnosing issues in real time

### Profiling
- Use perf, perfetto or dtrace to profile CPU usage and memory access patterns
- Look for cache misses and branch mispredictions; optimise accordingly

## Cross‑Platform Development Practices

### Conditional Compilation
- Use cfg attributes to isolate OS-specific code
- Avoid scattering #[cfg] throughout logic; concentrate in dedicated modules

### Platform Abstraction
- Define trait CpuTimer implemented separately for Linux, Windows, macOS
- Select implementation at compile time
- Use dyn CpuTimer only in less time-critical paths

### Testing Platforms
- Use GitHub Actions to test on multiple OSes
- Adopt local test machines for manual testing on less common architectures (e.g., ARM64 Mac)

### Error Handling
- Provide clear error messages when OS features (cgroups, job objects) unavailable
- Fallback gracefully; document platform-specific limitations

## Security & Safety

### Safe Rust First
- Avoid unsafe in public APIs; confine unsafe to small, well‑reviewed sections (e.g., FFI calls for timers and OS isolation)
- Document safety invariants

### Untrusted Workloads
- Provide guidelines for using OS isolation for untrusted or potentially malicious tasks
- Caution that isolation may require elevated privileges

### Vulnerability Audits
- Run cargo audit and cargo deny regularly
- Monitor dependency security advisories; update dependencies promptly

## Error Handling & Documentation

### Error Types
- Use descriptive error enums (e.g., PreemptionError) with context fields
- Implement Display and StdError traits; propagate errors via Result or Option

### Panics
- Avoid panics in library code; assert conditions with debug_assert! where appropriate
- Ensure macros do not generate panics except in erroneous usage clearly documented

### Examples
- Provide runnable examples for macros, TierManager usage, middleware integration, console monitoring and OS isolation
- Use comments to explain expected results
