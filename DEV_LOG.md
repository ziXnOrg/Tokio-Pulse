### Completed Tasks

#### 1. Comment Style Standardization
- **Issue**: Mixed comment styles (// vs /*) throughout codebase
- **Solution**: Systematically converted all /* */ block comments to // style across 15+ files
- **Files Modified**: All source files, tests, benchmarks, and macros
- **Impact**: Consistent code style adhering to Elite Rust standards

#### 2. Worker-Specific Statistics
- **Implementation**: Added comprehensive per-worker thread performance tracking
- **Key Features**:
  - Lock-free atomic counters for each worker thread
  - DashMap-based storage for thread-safe concurrent access
  - Tracks: polls, violations, yields, CPU time, tasks, slow polls per worker
  - <10ns overhead per metric update
- **API Methods**:
  - `get_worker_metrics(worker_id)` - Get metrics for specific worker
  - `get_all_worker_metrics()` - Get HashMap of all worker metrics
  - `reset_worker_stats(worker_id)` - Reset counters for specific worker
- **Testing**:
  - Created comprehensive test suite (worker_stats_comprehensive.rs)
  - Added property-based tests for invariant verification
  - Created performance benchmarks (worker_stats.rs)
- **Documentation**: Added extensive rustdoc with examples and performance notes

#### 3. Priority-Based Scheduling
- **Implementation**: Full priority-based task scheduling system
- **Priority Levels**:
  - Critical (0): System tasks - 4x budget, 0.25x escalation threshold
  - High (1): User-interactive - 2x budget, 0.5x escalation threshold
  - Normal (2): Standard tasks - 1x budget, 1x escalation threshold
  - Low (3): Background work - 0.5x budget, 2x escalation threshold
- **Key Components**:
  - `TaskContext::task_priority()` - Maps u8 priority to TaskPriority enum
  - `TaskContext::priority_threshold_multiplier()` - Adjusts tier escalation speed
  - `TaskContext::priority_budget_multiplier()` - Adjusts budget allocation
- **Integration**:
  - Modified TaskState to store and update TaskContext
  - Budget allocation adjusted based on priority during task creation
  - Tier escalation thresholds dynamically adjusted based on priority
- **Verification**: Tests confirm Critical tasks get 8000 budget vs Low tasks 1000 budget (8x difference)

### Current Architecture State

The system now has:
- **Foundation**: TaskBudget, cross-platform CPU timing, concurrency primitives
- **Tier Management**: 4-tier intervention system (Monitor→Warn→Yield→Isolate)
- **Worker Monitoring**: Per-worker thread statistics with lock-free updates
- **Priority Scheduling**: Priority-based budget allocation and tier escalation
- **Performance**: All operations maintain <100ns overhead requirement

### Next Task: Configurable Intervention Thresholds

#### Current State Analysis
Currently, intervention thresholds are partially hardcoded in TierConfig:
- Each TierPolicy has a fixed `promotion_threshold`
- Demotion thresholds are global (not per-tier)
- Some thresholds are in TierConfig but not fully configurable per tier

#### Requirements
1. Make all intervention thresholds configurable per tier
2. Support runtime updates without restart
3. Maintain backwards compatibility
4. Add validation to prevent invalid configurations
5. Document threshold tuning guidelines

#### Planned Implementation

##### 1. Enhanced TierPolicy Structure
```rust
pub struct TierPolicy {
    pub name: &'static str,
    pub action: InterventionAction,

    // Promotion thresholds
    pub promotion_threshold: u32,          // Existing
    pub promotion_cpu_threshold_ms: u64,   // NEW: CPU time trigger
    pub promotion_slow_poll_threshold: u32, // NEW: Slow poll count trigger

    // Demotion thresholds (per-tier instead of global)
    pub demotion_good_polls: u32,          // NEW: Good polls for demotion
    pub demotion_min_duration_ms: u64,     // NEW: Min time at tier
    pub demotion_cpu_threshold_ns: u64,    // NEW: Max CPU for "good" poll
}
```

##### 2. Configuration Builder Pattern
```rust
impl TierPolicyBuilder {
    pub fn new(name: &'static str) -> Self
    pub fn promotion_violations(mut self, threshold: u32) -> Self
    pub fn promotion_cpu_ms(mut self, threshold: u64) -> Self
    pub fn demotion_good_polls(mut self, threshold: u32) -> Self
    pub fn build(self) -> TierPolicy
}
```

##### 3. Runtime Configuration Updates
- Add `TierManager::update_tier_policy(tier: usize, policy: TierPolicy)`
- Atomic policy swapping with RwLock<Vec<TierPolicy>>
- Validation before applying updates

##### 4. Configuration Profiles
```rust
pub enum ConfigProfile {
    Aggressive,  // Low thresholds, quick intervention
    Balanced,    // Default balanced thresholds
    Permissive,  // High thresholds, slow intervention
    Custom(TierConfig),
}
```

##### 5. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for builder pattern
- Integration tests for runtime updates
- Property tests for threshold validation
- Benchmark impact of configuration changes

### Performance Metrics Update

Current system performance:
- Budget operations: <20ns
- CPU time measurement: <50ns
- Worker stats update: <10ns
- Priority adjustment: <5ns overhead
- Overall per-poll overhead: <100ns (target achieved)

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. Windows Job Object Handle Tracking Completion
- **Issue**: Windows Job Object handles were not being properly tracked or cleaned up
- **Solution**: Implemented thread-safe handle tracking using Mutex<HashMap>
- **Key Changes**:
  - Modified `WindowsJobManager` to store handles in `Mutex<HashMap<u64, HANDLE>>`
  - Added proper handle storage in `isolate_task()` method
  - Implemented handle cleanup in `release_task()` method
  - Added utility methods: `active_job_count()` and `is_task_isolated()`

#### 2. Test Infrastructure Fixes
- **Issue**: Multiple compilation errors and warnings across test suite
- **Solution**: Systematic fixes across tier_manager_properties.rs and other test files
- **Key Changes**:
  - Fixed missing TierPolicy fields (promotion_cpu_threshold_ms, promotion_slow_poll_threshold, etc.)
  - Added #[allow(dead_code)] annotations for intentionally unused test utilities
  - Resolved all compilation errors in property-based tests
- **Impact**: Full test suite now compiles and runs successfully
